/**
 * 
 * 
 * CustomerRepository extends the MongoRepository interface and plugs in the
 * type of values and id it works with: Customer and String. Out-of-the-box,
 * this interface comes with many operations, including standard CRUD operations
 * (create-read-update-delete).
 * 
 * You can define other queries as needed by simply declaring their method
 * signature. In this case, you add findByFirstName, which essentially seeks
 * documents of type Customer and finds the one that matches on firstName.
 * 
 * You also have findByLastName to find a list of people by last name.
 * 
 * In a typical Java application, you write a class that implements
 * CustomerRepository and craft the queries yourself. What makes Spring Data
 * MongoDB so useful is the fact that you don’t have to create this
 * implementation. Spring Data MongoDB creates it on the fly when you run the
 * application.*
